# DRAWERBOX

A simple 3d printed magic trick gimmick commonly known as the Drawer Box.

# THE EFFECT

Open the box and put some objects inside and close it up. Upon re-opening the box the items are missing. The box is closed once again and re-opened to show the original items.

# THE MECHANISM

The drawer contains two nested drawers, with the inner sliding freely inside the outer drawer. The inside drawer has a small latch that connects to the back panel when it is displaced.
